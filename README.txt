== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an error during installation, what do I do now? =

* "Error: An error occured in the request and at the time were unable to send the consumer data" : For security reasons, now you need to have a valid SSL certificate, and run the installation from a https domain. 
* "Not allowed": Please go to Wordpress Admin > WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API and delete all API keys starting with "spod - API (...)". Then go back to Spod Plugin and click on "Complete installation". This will retrigger the installation. 
* "Forbidden: You don't have permission to access this ressource": Please check security plugins and configurations and .htaccess file of your server that might still include some lines related to those plugins
